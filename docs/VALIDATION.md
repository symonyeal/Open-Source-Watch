# Validation

What must be checked, how, and what has been. Checks are invariants and recorded real
responses, never snapshots of live output.

| Every adapter parses a recorded real response | `tests/test_collect.py` (Telegram, FIRMS, ADS-B, alerts.com.ua, Neptun, Yahoo, CoinGecko, Polymarket); Tzeva Adom from upstream's interface | passing 2026-10-21 |

| Every route works through the engine | manual 2026-10-21: 23 routes 200; engine log 106 `/fetch`, 103 × 200, 3 × 502 (Reuters ×2, Kyiv Independent fail at origin); 0 unscheduled | observed 2026-10-21 |
| Full live collection | 176 sources: 169 ok, 1 empty, 3 http_error, 3 parse_error (preview-disabled channels, now `empty`); 4,944 raw → 4,589 observations, 38 track points | observed 2026-10-21 |

| Events do not depend on input order | `test_events_do_not_depend_on_input_order` (all permutations sampled) | passing 2026-10-21 |
| Credibility monotone in corroboration; contradiction → 5; table | `test_credibility_is_monotone_in_corroboration`, `test_contradiction_forces_improbable`, `test_credibility_table` | passing 2026-10-21 |
| Indicator and PIR status rules | `test_indicator_board` | passing 2026-10-21 |
